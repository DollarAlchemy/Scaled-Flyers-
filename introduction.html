            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Fire-breathing dragons have inspired myths and stories for centuries. This study imagines a real-world equivalent: "Scaled Flyers." These speculative organisms are examined for their evolutionary plausibility and ecological harmony.</p>

            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>To hypothesize the evolution of fire-breathing traits through natural selection and ecological necessity.</li>
                <li>To critique the anthropocentric view of intelligence and explore its role as a force for balance and coexistence in nature.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Key Questions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Could fire-breathing traits plausibly evolve in real organisms?</li>
                <li>What biological pathways and selective pressures might drive their development?</li>
                <li>How does intelligence in nature differ from human constructs of dominance?</li>
